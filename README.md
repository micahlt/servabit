### FAQ
#### What is Servabit?
Servabit is a _local backup software_ designed to run on Windows machines.  You can use it to select certain folders and back them up to a secondary drive, like a flash drive or external disk.

#### What does "servabit" mean?
Servabit is actually Latin for "it will protect", because the software is designed to prevent data loss.  

#### Does it work?
Not yet.  I've gotten down to a fully functional user interface, but actual backup capabilities have not been implemented.

#### Can I test it?
Sure!  Just check out [the releases page](https://github.com/micahlt/servabit/releases)!

#### Do you need help?
I'm not actually looking for help right now (as this is just a side project), but feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you feel like it!

#### How can I support you?
Why, you can [buy me a pizza](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/micahlt) of course! ðŸ˜Š
